We are excited to launch the "Munich School of Robotics and Machine Intelligence" blog! Here, we will write about our research done at the Institutes of the MSRM at TU Munich. However, no one likes to read densely written research papers (except maybe some Ph.D. students). We want to use this blog to also inform people outside of our research communities about what we are doing here and why we are excited about it. If you want to receive a mail when the blog is updated, you can subscribe under the "Subscribe" Button at the top of the page. We hope you enjoy the blog!
