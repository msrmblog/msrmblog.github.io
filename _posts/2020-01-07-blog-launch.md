The Autonomous Vision Group at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent System and the University of TÃ¼bingen is excited to launch our new research blog which will continuously provide updates on our latest research including non-technical descriptions, videos, links to technical papers, source code and datasets. Given the increased public interest in our research and AI in general, we believe that this blog will help making our findings more accessible, particularly also for interested readers outside the computer vision and machine learning field. If you like to follow this blog via email, simply click on the "Newsletter" or "Feed" buttons in the footer of this page. Feel free to send us your feedback on this blog!  We are looking forward to receiving your comments and improving this blog over time.
