We are excited to launch the "Munich School of Robotics and Machine Intelligence" blog! We want to use this outlet to write about our research done at the Institutes of the MSRM at TU Munich. 

However, not many like to read densely written research papers (except _some_ Ph.D. students). Our goal is to write in a clear and approachable manner about what we are doing here at MSRM and why we are excited about it. If you want to receive an mail when the blog is updated, you can subscribe under the "Subscribe" button at the top of the page.
